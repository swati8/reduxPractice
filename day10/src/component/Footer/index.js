        Create a React + Redux App, which does the following:  <br/>
        1.Users can come and add posts by entering email and the comment  <br/>
        2.The previous email should be displayed in the email text box, <br/>
        so it is easier to add more posts for same email <br/>
        3.Both email and comment are required  <br/>
        4.All the unique emails would be shown in the left Users section  <br/>
        5.All the posts would be shown on the right Posts section  <br/>
        6.A user can filter by clicking on any of the users on the left panel,  <br/>
        i.e If a user is selected, only his posts will be shown <br/>
        7.User can edit the comments. Email cannot be changed, only the content  <br/>
        8.User can delete the post. <br/>

        Show a confirmation before doing so.
    </div>
